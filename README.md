# TFT_FFT_Test
mbed TFT_FFT_Test

This project uses CMSIS DSP for FFT on mbed-os 5.8.2
I shows it on a Seeed 2.8" TFT Shield.
The wotk is much based on the work of Curtis Mattull here: https://os.mbed.com/users/cpm219/code/fft_test_k22f/

The display uses a SPI interface, hence it is not super fast to update the display.
